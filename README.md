## 2.Outlet Size Contribution

High outlet size generates the highest revenue ($508K).

Medium ($445K) and Small outlets ($249K) contribute significantly less.

Across outlet tiers, Tier 3 outlets lead with $472K in sales.

## 3.Item Type Performance

Average ratings across outlet types remain consistent at 3.9, indicating uniform customer satisfaction.

## Conclusions

Larger outlets and Tier 3 outlets are more profitable, making them key focus areas for growth.

Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods are the most profitable categories, while some categories (Breakfast, Seafood) need better promotion or optimization.

Consistent customer ratings (3.9) suggest steady service quality, but improving product variety and availability may push ratings higher.

Sales growth strategies should target expanding high-performing outlet sizes and increasing promotions for underperforming item categories.
